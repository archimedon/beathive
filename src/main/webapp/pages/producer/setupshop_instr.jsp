<h3>Upload your loops and get paid!</h3>
<br>
<b>Setting up a shop is free and only takes a minute.</b>

<br><br>

<b>Here's how it works:</b>
<br>
<ul class="general_list">
<li>You manage your own shop: upload loops, take down loops, edit shop info, and upload a shop banner. </li>
<li>All revenue is split 50/50 between you and BeatHive.com, after transaction costs (this usually averages out to 5-10% over time).</li>
<li>Royalties will be paid quarterly via your PayPal account, within 60 days of the end of each quarter. For example, for the first quarter, ending on March 31st, you will be paid your due royalties for that quarter by May 31st.</li>

<li>Set your own prices and monitor your shop's sales in realtime. </li>
<li>This is an non-exclusive agreement. You can sell your loops elsewhere. You keep all the rights.</li>
<li>You  must own all the rights to the loops you sell, which in general, usually means you recorded them yourself or paid for someone else to record them for you. </li>

<li>Loops must be uploaded in either APPLE LOOP AIFF or ACIDized WAV format or both.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
<b>Here's what we'll be asking you to set up a shop:</b>

<li>A shop name (This can be changed at any time).</li>
<li>An electronic signature of our agreement.</li>

<li>Your paypal address where you will receive your royalties. Don't have one? Get one <a href="http://www.paypal.com" target="_BLANK">here</a>.</li>
